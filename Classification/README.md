# Classification 

Welcome to the classification second, where I dive into the fascinating realm of classification methods in machine learning. 

Here, we'll journey through the theoretical foundations and practical applications of these powerful algorithms. 

In the [Theory](https://github.com/Yura-Qu/Machine-Learning-in-R/tree/main/Classification/Theory) subfolder, you'll see the intricate statistical theories that underpin various classification methodologies, gaining a deep understanding of their mathematical principles and algorithms. Meanwhile, the [Practical](https://github.com/Yura-Qu/Machine-Learning-in-R/tree/main/Classification/Practical) subfolder provides hands-on experience, where we apply these methods to real-world datasets using R. Through engaging examples and data analysis, you'll develop the skills to implement and evaluate classification algorithms, empowering you to tackle diverse challenges across different fields.
