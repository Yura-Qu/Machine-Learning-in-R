# Classification 

Here, i'll journey through the theoretical foundations and practical applications of these powerful algorithms. 

In the [Theory](https://github.com/Yura-Qu/Machine-Learning-in-R/tree/main/Classification/Theory) subfolder, you'll see the  statistical theories that underpin various classification methodologies, gaining a deep understanding of their mathematical principles and algorithms. Meanwhile, the [Practical](https://github.com/Yura-Qu/Machine-Learning-in-R/tree/main/Classification/Practical) subfolder provides experience, where i apply these methods to real-world datasets using R.
